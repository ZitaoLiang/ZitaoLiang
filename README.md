- 👋 Hi, I’m @ZitaoLiang
- 🎓 I'm currently studying in IMECAS for Master's degree.
- 💻 I'm interested in the whole stack "from C to silicon".
- 📫 Here is my email: liangzitao22@gmail.com
- 📫 Why 22? Inspired by ***Soul***, I seek to keep feeling my sparks like 22.
- 😄 Still pondering an English name—perhaps **Tivon** could be the one.
- ✈ Always looking forward to the next adventure!
- 🤗 Sharing my growth trajectory here :)
